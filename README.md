Arduino Code for UoB, Dept EEE, Project week 3 - Mechatronics Escape Room

This is all versions of the code I have written for the third project week spanning 04/03/2024 - 08/03/2024.

This code does not use any external libraries, however does make use of multiple push buttons, LEDs, a Speaker and a Shake Sensor
More documentation about using the Speaker and Shake Sensor can be found here:

Shake Sensor: https://wiki.dfrobot.com/Gravity_Digital_Shake_Sensor_SKU_SEN0289


NOTE - Running of Code

This code will run regardless of correct/incorrect connections to the Arduino. Please ensure that you have connected each button and LED correctly and securely as the code itself will not produce error messages, instead just won't work.

NOTE - Arduino Version

The board used in this project is the Arduino Nano ESP32 with Bluetooth and WiFi capabilities. These avenues could be explored. Due to the small size of the board, the project was able to be very compact and fit on a singular breadboard. If using a different sized board, please check connections and change the pin layout lines 32-41.


If you have any issues please email me at rb2521@bath.ac.uk and I will get back to you as soon as I can.

Thanks!
